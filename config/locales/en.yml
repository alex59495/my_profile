# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

      about-me-text_html: "I've graduated as an Urban Engineer on 2016, but since before that, I have felt attracted to IT and technologies in general. So, in 2019, while living in <strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong>, I fortunately came across <strong style='color: rgb(106, 9, 125);'>Le Wagon</strong>'s methodology and decided to begin my professional qualification as a web development on a part-time course from January to June 2020. Since then, I've been working on projects of my own while I keep improving my abilities by learning new frameworks, languages and everything else that can make me better at what I do."
